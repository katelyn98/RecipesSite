This is probably Asher's favorite - he gets very creative when it comes to cooking dinner platters. Here, you can find several recipes so far that he has tried and were super delicious! 

## Beef {-}
### Beef and Broccoli {-}

  + sake
* 3 TBSP + 2 TSP soy sauce
* 1 TBSP cornstarch

* 1 half slivered green pepper
* 2 TBSP unsalted butter

*Instructions* 

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the wine, 2 tablespoons of the soy sauce, 1/2 TSP of chili-garlic sauce and the cornstarch. Add the beef to the bowl, and toss to combine, then cover the bowl, and set aside for 20 minutes or so.
2. Combine in a small bowl the remaining soy sauce, the oyster sauce, and the chile-garlic sauce. Mix together then add a TBSP of water and mix again. Set aside for later.
3. Heat the 1/2 cup of oil in a wok set over high heat. When the oil is hot and shimmering, add about holf the beef to the wok, and stir-fry until it is browned, crips, and barely cooked through (~ 2 minutes). Transfer to a bowl or plate, and set aside. Repeat with the remaining beef.
4. Pour off the oil in the wok, wipe it out with a towel and return it to the stove on high heat. Add the remaining TBSP of oil, swirl it around and heat it until it is smoking. Add the broccoli and cook, tossing and stirring frequently until lightly charred in spots (~ 2 minutes)
5. Add 2 TSBP water to the wok and toss the broccoli in the steam for an additional 2 minutes. Add the beef back to the wok, then add the sauce you made. Cook, stirring and tossing frequently, for 30 seconds or so. Add the butter and stir and toss again for 30 more seconds. Serve immediately with rice

![Steak au Poivre](https://github.com/katelyn98/RecipesSite/blob/website/IMG_1698.JPG)

*Ingredients*

* 4 beef tenderloin steaks
  + 6 ounces each -> cut 1 inch thick
* Salt
* 1 TBSP coarsely crushed black pepper
* 1 TSP coarsely crushed Sichuan pepper
* 2 TBSP unsalted butter
* 2 large shallots
  + finely diced
* 1 1/2 cups rich beef or chicken broth

*Instructions* 

1. Put steaks in a shallow dish and season well on both sides with salt. Sprinkle black pepper and Sichuan pepper evenly over steaks. Press pepper into both sides with hands and leave for 10 minutes
2. Put a large cast iron skillet over high heat. When surface is nearly smoking, swirl 1 TBSP butter in the pan and add steaks. Adjust heat as necessary to keep steaks sizzling briskly.
3. Cook for 2 minutes on first side; seared side should be nicely browned. Flip and cook for 2 minutes more. Transfer steaks to a warm platter.
4. Make the sauce: Add 1 TBSP butter to the pan. Add shallot and saute for a minute or so, stirring, until they begin to brown. Add broth and bring to a brisk simmer. Add cognac or bourbon and continue to simmer until reduced by half, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in creme fraiche and cook until sauce is lightly thickened. 
5. Return steaks to pan to warm, spooning sauce over them and turning once. Arrange steaks on platter or individual plates and top with more sauce. Garnish with bouquets of watercress and serve immediately.

*Notes*

* Best served with homemade mashed potatoes
* Don't overcook the meat!

*Wine*

Cabernet Sauvignon, Bordeaux, or Châteauneuf-du-Pape

## Chicken {-}
### Harissa Chicken {-}

*Ingredients*

* 2 TBSP harissa (New York Shuk Signature Harissa)
  + 5 TBSP if mild (recommended)
* 4 1/2 TBSP extra-virgin olive oil
* 2 1/2 TSP kosher or flaky sea salt
* 1.2 TSP freshly ground black pepper
* 1/2 TSP ground cumin
* 3 chicken thighs (recommended)
* 3 chicken legs
* 1 1/2 pounds roasting potatoes (such as Yukon Golds)
  + peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch (4cm) cubes
* 2 bunches of scallions
  + washed, sliced in half lengthwise, and thinly sliced crossways
* grated zest of one lemon
* 1 cup *plain* yogurt
  + IT IS IMPORTANT THAT IT IS PLAIN YOGURT not greek yogurt!
* 1 clove garlic
  + peeled and minced
* lemon or lime juice
* 1 cup (10-12g) a mix of fresh herbs coarsely chopped
  + parsley
  + mint
  + dill
  + chervil
  + tarragon

*Marinade Instructions*

1. In a large bowl, mix together the harissa, 3 tablespoons of the olive oil, cumin, 2 1/2 teaspoons of the salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of the black pepper. 
2. Add the chicken and potatoes, then rub the thighs and legs and potatoes with the marinade. Be sure to use your hands to rub the sauce under the skin of the chicken. Let stand for 30 minutes at room temperature.
3. In a medium bowl, toss the leeks together with the lemon zest, 1/4 of the salt, and the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil.
4. Preheat the oven to 425ºF (220ºC). Adjust the oven rack to the center of the oven
5. Transfer the chicken and potatoes, and any sauce in the bowl, onto a large rimmed baking sheet. Arrange the chicken pieces so they are skin side up, and make sure the chicken parts and potatoes are in a single layer. Bake for 20 minutes.
6. Remove the baking sheet from the oven. Toss the potatoes (so they can brown on the other sides of them) then strew the leeks over everything on the baking sheet. It may look like a lot, but they'll bake down.
7. Bake until the chicken is cooked through, another 20 to 25 minutes. While the chicken is cooking, in a small bowl, mix the yogurt with the garlic, the remaining salt and pepper, and a squeeze of fresh lemon or lime juice.
8. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and spoon the yogurt sauce in various places over the chicken and potatoes. Top with fresh herbs and serve.

*Wine*

Unknown - Probably couldn't go wrong with Gerwürztraminer or an off-dry Riesling.

### Chipotle Chicken {-}

*Ingredients* 

For the chicken:

* Juice of 2 limes
* ½ cup of vegetable or canola oil
* 1 tsp. kosher salt
* ¾ tsp. chili powder
* ¾ tsp. paprika
* ½ tsp. cumin
* ¼ tsp. cayenne pepper
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 tbsp. brown sugar
* 1 chipotle in adobo, seeded and minced
  + recommended to use 4 or 5
* 2 lbs. chicken breasts and/or thighs, cut into 1½-2 inch pieces
* Minced fresh cilantro, for serving

For the avocado cream sauce:

* 1 avocado, split and pitted
* ½ cup low-fat greek yogurt
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* Juice of 1 lime
* Salt and pepper, to taste

*Instructions*

1. In a medium bowl or a baking dish/pie plate, combine the lime juice, oil, spices, garlic, brown sugar, and chipotle.  Whisk together to combine.  Add the chicken pieces to the marinade and mix well to ensure that they are all coated and mostly submerged.  Cover, refrigerate, and let marinate for 30-60 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, heat a grill to medium-high and oil the grates.  When the chicken is done marinating, thread the pieces onto skewers for grilling.  (If using wooden skewers, be sure to soak them first to prevent charring/burning.)  Dispose of the excess marinade.  Place the kabobs on the grill and let cook, turning once or twice, until all sides are slightly browned and the internal temperature registers 160˚ F on an instant-read thermometer.  Remove to a plate and let rest 5-10 minutes.  Sprinkle with minced fresh cilantro, if desired.
3. To make the sauce, combine the avocado, yogurt, garlic and lime juice in the bowl of a food processor or a blender.  Process until smooth.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Serve alongside the kabobs for dipping.

*Notes*

* Use more chipotles in adobo sauce (like four or five) and the juice.
* Don't bother with the skewers. Just fry it up in a pan.
* Serve in flour tortillas with crunchy lettuce.

*Chef's Notes*

Adapted from NYT cooking recipe: more potatoes, less chicken is our advice. Nice when served with salad with tangy dressing.

## Breads & Dough {-}

### Breadsticks {-}

Hang on. Asher is making breadsticks copied from *Olive Garden*? Hang on, folks.
(Note: Asher has never been to Olive Garden nor does he intend to go.)

*Ingredients*

* 1 cup + 2T warm water (110 - 115 degrees)
* 1.25t active dry yeast
* 2T granulated sugar
  + divided
* 3 - 3.5 cups all-purpose flour
* 1.75t salt
* 3T vegetable oil or olive oil

Topping:

* 2T butter
* 1/4t salt
* 1/4t garlic powder

*Instructions*

1. Make bread using the ingredients listed. No surprises here.
2. Rise for 1.5 hours.
3. Make into 12 bread sticks. Put them on parchment paper. Brush them with oil. Cover with saran wrap (the oil keeps this from sticking). Rise for an hour.
4. Bake at 425F for 11 - 13 minutes until golden.
5. Brush with the delicious topping. Probably double it. Butter is good.
6. Eat.

*Chef's Notes*

It's just bread. I'm not sure what differentiates this from other bread recipes. The topping is really good, and these were delicious. I'm sure they were better than Olive Garden, even though I have never been there.

*Wine Pairing*

Lots.

### Pizza Dough {-}

*Ingredients*

* 3 1/2 to 4 cups bread flour, plus more for rolling
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 1 envelope instant dry yeast
* 2 teaspoons kosher salt
* 1 1/2 cups water, 110 degrees F
* 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus 2 teaspoons

*Instructions*

1. Combine the bread flour, sugar, yeast and kosher salt in the bowl of a stand mixer and combine. While the mixer is running, add the water and 2 tablespoons of the oil and beat until the dough forms into a ball. If the dough is sticky, add additional flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together in a solid ball. If the dough is too dry, add additional water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead into a smooth, firm ball.
2. Grease a large bowl with the remaining 2 teaspoons olive oil, add the dough, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in a warm area to let it double in size, about 1 hour. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide it into 2 equal pieces. Cover each with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let them rest for 10 minutes.

*Notes*

* Knead with hands. Work around the volume of water, adding flour as needed. 
* Give the dough time to rise!

### Tortillas {-}

*Ingredients* 

* 3 cups flour
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 4.5 Tablespoons oil
* 1 cup water

*Instructions*

1. Heat oil and water until pretty hot, approx. 140 F. 
2. Mix with flour and salt and knead until combined. 

*Notes*

* A bit of bread flour (1 out of 3 cups) makes the tortillas sturdier.
