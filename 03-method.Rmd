## Chicken {-}
### Harissa Chicken {-}

*Ingredients*

* 2 TBSP harissa (New York Shuk Signature Harissa)
  + 5 TBSP if mild (recommended)
* 4 1/2 TBSP extra-virgin olive oil
* 2 1/2 TSP kosher or flaky sea salt
* 1.2 TSP freshly ground black pepper
* 1/2 TSP ground cumin
* 3 chicken thighs (recommended)
* 3 chicken legs
* 1 1/2 pounds roasting potatoes (such as Yukon Golds)
  + peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch (4cm) cubes
* 2 bunches of scallions
  + washed, sliced in half lengthwise, and thinly sliced crossways
* grated zest of one lemon
* 1 cup *plain* yogurt
  + IT IS IMPORTANT THAT IT IS PLAIN YOGURT not greek yogurt!
* 1 clove garlic
  + peeled and minced
* lemon or lime juice
* 1 cup (10-12g) a mix of fresh herbs coarsely chopped
  + parsley
  + mint
  + dill
  + chervil
  + tarragon

*Marinade Instructions*

1. In a large bowl, mix together the harissa, 3 tablespoons of the olive oil, cumin, 2 1/2 teaspoons of the salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of the black pepper. 
2. Add the chicken and potatoes, then rub the thighs and legs and potatoes with the marinade. Be sure to use your hands to rub the sauce under the skin of the chicken. Let stand for 30 minutes at room temperature.
3. In a medium bowl, toss the leeks together with the lemon zest, 1/4 of the salt, and the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil.
4. Preheat the oven to 425ºF (220ºC). Adjust the oven rack to the center of the oven
5. Transfer the chicken and potatoes, and any sauce in the bowl, onto a large rimmed baking sheet. Arrange the chicken pieces so they are skin side up, and make sure the chicken parts and potatoes are in a single layer. Bake for 20 minutes.
6. Remove the baking sheet from the oven. Toss the potatoes (so they can brown on the other sides of them) then strew the leeks over everything on the baking sheet. It may look like a lot, but they'll bake down.
7. Bake until the chicken is cooked through, another 20 to 25 minutes. While the chicken is cooking, in a small bowl, mix the yogurt with the garlic, the remaining salt and pepper, and a squeeze of fresh lemon or lime juice.
8. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and spoon the yogurt sauce in various places over the chicken and potatoes. Top with fresh herbs and serve.

### Chipotle Chicken {-}

*Ingredients* 

For the chicken:

* Juice of 2 limes
* ½ cup of vegetable or canola oil
* 1 tsp. kosher salt
* ¾ tsp. chili powder
* ¾ tsp. paprika
* ½ tsp. cumin
* ¼ tsp. cayenne pepper
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 tbsp. brown sugar
* 1 chipotle in adobo, seeded and minced
  + recommended to use 4 or 5
* 2 lbs. chicken breasts and/or thighs, cut into 1½-2 inch pieces
* Minced fresh cilantro, for serving

For the avocado cream sauce:

* 1 avocado, split and pitted
* ½ cup low-fat greek yogurt
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* Juice of 1 lime
* Salt and pepper, to taste

*Instructions*

1. In a medium bowl or a baking dish/pie plate, combine the lime juice, oil, spices, garlic, brown sugar, and chipotle.  Whisk together to combine.  Add the chicken pieces to the marinade and mix well to ensure that they are all coated and mostly submerged.  Cover, refrigerate, and let marinate for 30-60 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, heat a grill to medium-high and oil the grates.  When the chicken is done marinating, thread the pieces onto skewers for grilling.  (If using wooden skewers, be sure to soak them first to prevent charring/burning.)  Dispose of the excess marinade.  Place the kabobs on the grill and let cook, turning once or twice, until all sides are slightly browned and the internal temperature registers 160˚ F on an instant-read thermometer.  Remove to a plate and let rest 5-10 minutes.  Sprinkle with minced fresh cilantro, if desired.
3. To make the sauce, combine the avocado, yogurt, garlic and lime juice in the bowl of a food processor or a blender.  Process until smooth.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Serve alongside the kabobs for dipping.

*Notes*

* Use more chipotles in adobo sauce (like four or five) and the juice.
* Don't bother with the skewers. Just fry it up in a pan.
* Serve in flour tortillas with crunchy lettuce.

## Breads & Dough {-}
### Pizza Dough {-}

*Ingredients*

* 3 1/2 to 4 cups bread flour, plus more for rolling
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 1 envelope instant dry yeast
* 2 teaspoons kosher salt
* 1 1/2 cups water, 110 degrees F
* 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus 2 teaspoons

*Instructions*

1. Combine the bread flour, sugar, yeast and kosher salt in the bowl of a stand mixer and combine. While the mixer is running, add the water and 2 tablespoons of the oil and beat until the dough forms into a ball. If the dough is sticky, add additional flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together in a solid ball. If the dough is too dry, add additional water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead into a smooth, firm ball.
2. Grease a large bowl with the remaining 2 teaspoons olive oil, add the dough, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in a warm area to let it double in size, about 1 hour. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide it into 2 equal pieces. Cover each with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let them rest for 10 minutes.

*Notes*

* Knead with hands. Work around the volume of water, adding flour as needed. 
* Give the dough time to rise!
