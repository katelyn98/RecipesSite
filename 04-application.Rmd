# Desserts & Cocktails {-}

Desserts and cocktails are one of the most memorable dishes from a dinner party. Asher particular loves finishing off a good dinner with a creative dessert such as lemon posset or panna cotta. You can never go wrong with finishing your dinner party with one of these desserts...and if you want to spice things up a bit, make a cocktail to follow the dessert!

## Cakes {-}
### Carrot Cake {-}

### Pumpkin Caramel Cream Roulade {-}

One easy trick to train your cake to be a spiral!

*Ingredients*

Cake
* Unsalted butter for greasing
* 160g all-purpose flour
* 1 t cinnamon
* 0.75 t baking powder
* 0.25 t baking soda
* 0.5 t kosher salt
* 1 cup pumpkin puree
* 3 eggs
* 0.5 C sugar
* 0.5 C dark brown sugar
* 1 t vanilla extract
* powdered sugar for dusting

Caramel Cream Filling
* 0.5 C sugar
* 0.25 C heavy cream
* 1 t unsalted butter
* 8 oz cream cheese, cubed and room temp
* 0.25 C powdered sugar

Whipped Cream for Folding into Caramel Cream
* 0.5 C heavy cream

*Instructions*
1. Heat oven to 350F. Butter 13x18 baking sheet. Line with parchment (note: foil works better!)
and butter that too (wow!).
2. Cake: In one bowl, whisk together flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, salt. In another, whisk together pumpkin, eggs, sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla until smooth. Fold the dry into the wet, eliminating any lumps.
3. Spread the batter on the prepared sheet in an even layer. Bake until springs back when pressed gently in the center, about 15 minutes.
4. Put a clean dish towel on a work surface and dust thoroughly with powdered sugar.
5. Flip the cake onto the towel and peel off the parchment. Starting from one of the short edges of the towel, roll the cake and towel into a spiral gently. Transfer towel-cake to rack to cool completely.
6. Prepare the filling while the cake bakes: Add 1 T water to a small saucepan. Add sugar and bring to boil; simmer, without stirring, over medium high heat. Swirl when brown spots appear so it cooks evenly. Cook 6-8 mins until it's a deep amber color. Remove from heat and stir in cream, butter (watch out, it bubbles).
7. Cook for another minute over medium heat until smooth and creamy. Pour into bowl of stand mixer (or hand mixer), let cool for a few minutes. Don't cool it completely because it's, uh, caramel.
8. With mixer on low, add cream cheese cubes one piece at a time. Beat in powdered sugar. Chill until completely cold.
9. Whip 0.5 C heavy cream to stiff peaks, and fold it into the caramel cream.
10. Carefully unroll the cooled cake. Spread the filling evenly over it, then roll up without towel. (If you include the towel, you deserve it.) Trim the ends of the cake so it is ~pretty~. Transfer to a ~pretty~ serving plate and ~prettily~ dust with powdered sugar.

*Chef's Notes*

This was great and was breakfast for like two weeks. Adapted from NYT cooking. Psst: We just got rid of the coffee in theirs.

2. In a separate bowl stir together sugars and molasses. Try to stir out any chunks.

## No-bake Desserts {-}
### Lemon Posset w/ Watermelon Granita {-}

This original no-bake dessert consists of lemon posset topped with watermelon granita, blueberry compote and crushed pistachios.

Lemon Posset:

*Ingredients*

* 2 cups heavy whipping cream
* 2/3 cups (4 2/3 ounces or 132 grams) granulated sugar
* 1 TBSP grate lemon zest
* 6 TBSP freshly squeezed lemon juice
* 1 1/2 cups blueberries (for garnish)

*Instructions*

1. In a medium saucepan, combine cream, sugar, and lemon zest. Bring to a boil over medium heat. and continue to boil, stirring frequently to dissolve the sugar. If the mixture begins to boil over, briefly remove from heat. Cook until mixture is reduced to 2 cups, 8 to 12 minutes. Reducing the cream mixture to exactly 2 cups creates the best consistency. To monitor the amount, transfer the liquid to a 2-cup heatproof liquid measuring cup once or twice during boiling.
2. Remove saucepan from the heat and stir in the lemon juice. Let sit until mixture is cooled slightly and skin forms on top, about 20 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer into bowl or liquid measuring cup with a spout; discard zest. Divide mixture evenly among 6 individual ramekins or serving glasses or 12 shot glasses. Portioning is key, as spooning the set dessert from one large serving bowl will cause the texture to suffer.
3. Refrigerate, uncovered, until set, at least 3 hours. Once chilled, possets can be wrapped in plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 2 days. Unwrap and let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes before serving. If desired, garnish with berries and a few springs of lemon peel and serve.

*Notes*

* Chill well ahead of time of serving!
* The ratios are super important for a perfect posset
* Remove the skin after you boil the cream with a strainer

*Ingredients*

* 1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin

3. Once the cream has almost reached the boiling point, remove from heat and add vanilla extract and bloomed gelatin. Stir until fully dissolved.
