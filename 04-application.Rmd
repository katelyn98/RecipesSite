2. In a separate bowl stir together sugars and molasses. Try to stir out any chunks.

4. Add in sugar mixture and cream together until smooth.
5. Add eggs and mix on low speed for 15-30 seconds. There is no need to completely mix in the eggs.
6. Add the flour ingredients in 2 batches, mixing slowly until just combined.

8. Let dough chill for 30 minutes and preheat oven to 325 degrees F.

## No-bake Desserts {-}
### Lemon Posset w/ Watermelon Granita {-}

![Lemon Posset](https://github.com/katelyn98/RecipesSite/blob/website/IMG_9387.jpeg)

This original no-bake dessert consists of lemon posset topped with watermelon granita, blueberry compote and crushed pistachios.

Lemon Posset:

*Ingredients*

* 2 cups heavy whipping cream
* 2/3 cups (4 2/3 ounces or 132 grams) granulated sugar
* 1 TBSP grate lemon zest
* 6 TBSP freshly squeezed lemon juice
* 1 1/2 cups blueberries (for garnish)

*Instructions*

1. In a medium saucepan, combine cream, sugar, and lemon zest. Bring to a boil over medium heat. and continue to boil, stirring frequently to dissolve the sugar. If the mixture begins to boil over, briefly remove from heat. Cook until mixture is reduced to 2 cups, 8 to 12 minutes. Reducing the cream mixture to exactly 2 cups creates the best consistency. To monitor the amount, transfer the liquid to a 2-cup heatproof liquid measuring cup once or twice during boiling.
2. Remove saucepan from the heat and stir in the lemon juice. Let sit until mixture is cooled slightly and skin forms on top, about 20 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer into bowl or liquid measuring cup with a spout; discard zest. Divide mixture evenly among 6 individual ramekins or serving glasses or 12 shot glasses. Portioning is key, as spooning the set dessert from one large serving bowl will cause the texture to suffer.
3. Refrigerate, uncovered, until set, at least 3 hours. Once chilled, possets can be wrapped in plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 2 days. Unwrap and let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes before serving. If desired, garnish with berries and a few springs of lemon peel and serve.

*Notes*

* Chill well ahead of time of serving!
* The ratios are super important for a perfect posset
* Remove the skin after you boil the cream with a strainer

Watermelon Granita: 

*Ingredients*

* 1/2 whole seedless watermelon
  + Cut into chucnk (about 8 cups of chunks)

2. Repeat with other half of ingredients. Pour into same bowl as other batch.
3. Transfer mixture to a 9 x 13 baking dish. Freeze for two or three hours, then begin the process of lightly scraping the top, frozen layer.
4.  Return pan to freezer with the shaved ice on top; remove a couple of hours later and continue scraping. Repeat the occasional scraping process until the entire mixture is shaved. Store, covered in plastic wrap, until serving.

*Ingredients*

* 1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin
* 1 tablespoon cold water
* 1 ½ cups heavy cream
* ¼ cup sugar

2. In a small saucepan, combine heavy cream with sugar and cook over medium until it’s at the scalding point, or just under a boil.
3. Once the cream has almost reached the boiling point, remove from heat and add vanilla extract and bloomed gelatin. Stir until fully dissolved.
4. Strain panna cotta mixture into desired serving tempered glasses.
5. Allow cream to come to room temperature before chilling in the fridge for 2-4 hours, or until the cream is firm in texture.
